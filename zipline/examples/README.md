Algos for testing out
=====================


Trend-following overlay and momentum regime change signal
---------------------------------------------------------

* Calculate the past 12-month momentum for each asset class using monthly excess returns, defined as the excess return above the Treasury Bill.
* If the asset momentum is positive, hold the asset for the next month.  If the momentum is negative, switch into the 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill.

Paper uses the following assets: MSCI US, MSCI EAFE, Barclays Capital Long U.S. Treasury, Intermediate U.S. Treasury, U.S. Credit, U.S. High Yield Corporate, U.S. Government & Credit, and U.S. Aggregate Bond indices, 90-day U.S. Treasury bills, FTSE NAREIT, S&P GSCI, and monthly gold returns
Paper shows that adding this momentum overlay to a 60/40 portfolio adds significant value by reducing drawdowns.
Paper also show this adds value when applied to a 5 asset portfolio (called the parity portfolio in the paper).

Meaningless trend-follower
--------------------------

* Calculate daily MA with different lags and normalize MA by dividing by monthly closing prices.
* Run cross-sectional regressions each month regressing monthly stock returns on the normalized MAs.
* Estimate the expected return for month t using the moving averages of the coefficients in the 12 months prior to month t and the normalized MAs from month t-1.
* Sort expected return into quintile.
* Long top 20% and short 20%, re-balance monthly.

Backwardation spreads
---------------------

* sell contango contracts where forward prices exceed spot prices
* buy  backwardation contracts where forward prices are lower than spot prices

Most of the profit comes from selling the contangoed contracts - what does that imply?

Contango is when the futures price is above the expected future spot price. Because the futures price must converge on the expected future spot price, contango implies that futures prices are falling over time as new information brings them into line with the expected future spot price.

Normal backwardation is when the futures price is below the expected future spot price. This is desirable for speculators who are "net long" in their positions: they want the futures price to increase. So, normal backwardation is when the futures prices are increasing.



ADHD
----

Stocks with the strongest prior 12-month returns experience a
significant average market-adjusted return of 1.58 percent during the
five trading days before their earnings announcements and a
significant average market-adjusted return of 1.86 percent in the five
trading days afterward.



Cheapskate
----------

Buy top decile of stocks with lowest price-to-book
Rebalance monthly



Beat the shorts
---------------

Overweight the S&P500 sectors with the highest short interest (as a
percentage of shares outstanding) vs those with the lowest short
interest.

the single best way to be short is by buying deep in-the-money put options on the Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bull 3x Shares (SPXL).

you should short a leveraged long fund rather than buy a leveraged short fund when you want to short the broader market. In other words, short SPXL rather than buy SPXS.


Measurement
===========

it will be nice to provide sample to calculate MFE / MAE / BSO of each
trade using Zipline

MAE - Maximum Adverse Excursion is the maximum draw down the trade had
before the trade was closed.

MFE - Maximum Favorable Excursion is the maximum paper profit the
trade had before the trade was closed.

BSO: Best Scale Out. The closer your BSO is to the MFE, the better and
more efficient your Exit strategy isâ€¦ basically, not leaving too much
money on the table.
